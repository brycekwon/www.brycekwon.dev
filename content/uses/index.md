# Uses

There are a few things I deem essential for my personal workflow in everyday life. Here is a curated list of gear and apps that I use pretty much daily, inspired by Wes Bos' [uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

Just a note, I am very much entrenched in the Apple ecosystem, so most of my choices will reflect that. I am also a bit more privacy-conscious than the average person, so I tend to lean towards services that respect that.

## Hardware

### Laptop

My laptop is by far the most important piece of hardware I own and is used for everything from work to entertainment. For this, I choose to use the [MacBook Pro 16-inch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111901) with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage due to its balance of power and portability.

### Phone

My phone is a device I use primarily for communication and photography, having only the minimum number of apps installed. For this, I choose to use the [iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/specs/) with 256GB of storage due to its balance of power and camera quality.

## Software

### Notes

Notes are an integral part of my workflow, used for everything from jotting down ideas to keeping track of tasks. Being a student as well, I use notes to keep ontop my classes and assignments. For this, I choose to use [Apple Notes](https://www.apple.com/ios/notes/) due to the simplicity it provides and privacy protection with Apple's *Advanced Data Protection*.

### Browser

Browsers are the primary means of accessing the internet and are used for everything from research to entertainment. For this, I choose to use [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) due to its compromise between privacy and productivity, as well as its built-in optimizations for Apple devices.

### Passwords

Passwords are used to secure my online accounts and encrypt data on my devices. Their security is paramount to my privacy and security. For this, I choose to use [Keepass](/README.md) due to its open-source nature and the control it provides over my data. For a more user-friendly feel, I use [Strongbox](https://strongboxsafe.com) for accessing my Keepass databases on Apple devices.

## Online

### Email

Email is the primary form of communication I use for work and managing my online accounts. For this, I choose to use [Apple Mail](https://www.icloud.com/mail) due to privacy features such as *Mail Privacy Protection* and *Hide My Email*.

### Messages

Messages are the primary form of communication I use for personal communication. For this, I choose to use [Apple iMessage](https://www.apple.com/imessage/) due to privacy features such as *End-to-End Encryption*.

### Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is used to store my files and data securely and access them from any device. For this, I choose to use [Apple iCloud](https://www.icloud.com) due to its seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem and the privacy it provides with Apple's *Advanced Data Protection*.
