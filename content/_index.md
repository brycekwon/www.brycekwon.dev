I'm Bryce Kwon, a fourth-year computer science student at the [University of Portland](https://www.up.edu). My interests include software engineering, computer networks, and cybersecurity.

This website serves as a platform for me to introduce myself, showcase my projects, and share my thoughts on topics I care about. Please note that it is still a **work in progress**.
